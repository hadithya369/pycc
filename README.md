# pycc
A competitive coding tool to help compile, run and test c++ files.

Usage:
Run the setup.py to set the c++ file to be compiled, the name of the object file you want the output file and expected output file.

Run the main.py to compile, run and test your c++ code.
Add --s if you want to check if 2 files are identical. The default idea is to break your output and expected output into tokens and compare those.
Note : Make sure to write your output to the files specified above in your c++ code.
